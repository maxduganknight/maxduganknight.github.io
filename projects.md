### [An Exploration of the Role of Likert Items in School-Based Survey Analysis.][likert-paper]

Presented at the annual conference of the <i>American Educational Research Association (AERA)</i>, 2019

This paper explores Likert item treatment in school-based surveys. It is common to treat Likert items on education surveys as interval data and perform arithmetic analyses reserved for interval data on this ordinal data. To explore the treatment of Likert items in school-based surveys the items are analyzed as interval and ordinal in two different use cases, 1) survey design and 2) analysis of results. Scale creation is analyzed using principle component analysis (PCA) and categorical principle component analysis (CATPCA). Both CATPCA and PCA yielded comparable results. Survey results are analyzed using a stratified sample t-test and ordinal regression. The t-test approach examines the difference in means. Conversely, the ordinal regression approach treats the data as ordinal. The ordinal regression approach yielded results that are largely consistent with the results from the stratified sample approach.
